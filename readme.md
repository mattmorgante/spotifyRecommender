How to run me: 
* clone the repository: git clone 
* npm install
* cd app 
* node app.js 
* navigate to localhost:8888 and get started!

As a user I can: 
* log in with my spotify account
* Access my top tracks 
* Select up to 5 of these tracks 
* Receive recommendations based on the selected tracks 
* Refresh the page and all data will persist via local storage

Limitations/ToDos: 
- if a track has multiple artists it will only display the first one 
- Can only select 5 tracks 
- Not using redux
